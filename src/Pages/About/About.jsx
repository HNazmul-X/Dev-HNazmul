                I am H. Nazmul Hassan, a Full Stack Developer with a strong background in front-end development. I have been working in the field for about 3 years and have a wide range of skills and
                experience. My primary backend skills include Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, while my front-end skills include Svelte, Svelteki, Next.js, React.js, GSAP, and Tailwind. I am
                currently working on thelaboratory.io, and am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
